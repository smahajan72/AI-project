Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which 
the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. 
Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. 
The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.

In this project, I'll build an game playing agent by implement adversarial searching algorithms (Minimax and AlphaBeta) to beat other players.
These methods are in the ProjectSubmission.py file.
